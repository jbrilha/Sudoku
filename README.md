# Sudoku!

### Wanted to start using Neovim as my main editor so I figured I'd challenge myself to make one of my favorite passtimes in it
Started with Python because why not, eventually the goal is to make Sudoku in different languages to serve as practice

The code will most definitely not be super optimized as my goal is to simply get working versions but I'll get around to trimming the edges eventually :D
